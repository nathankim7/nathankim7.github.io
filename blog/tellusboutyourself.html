<div style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Courier Prime', Courier, monospace"><p style="max-width: 60%"><b>&quot;tellusboutyourself&quot; by Yerin Baek (백예린)</b></p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">Korean-style synthpop record with elements of dance and R&amp;B. K-indie queen Yerin Baek returns
		for her second full-length album, trading off the wistful keys and guitar ballads of 2019&#39;s
		&quot;Every letter I sent you&quot; for a MIDI-programmed sound that retains her trademark melancholy at
		its heart. The record&#39;s fourteen tracks aren&#39;t coy about their influences, ranging from city pop
		to dancepop to K-R&amp;B, but they do iterate on them with a consistency and warmth which fans of
		Ms. Baek will find to their liking. Though, once again, listeners in the Anglophone world may
		find themselves puzzling over the lyricism, whose stiff verbiage sometimes struggles to provide
		the expressive power demanded of the regret-soaked retrospectives recounted in these tracks.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">RIYL: The Volunteers, Oohyo</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">FCC No-goes: 1, 10, probably 14</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">Track-by-track (* indicates a fave):</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">1. Lovegame*--Murkey keys overlaid with razor-sharp guitar riffs and synth chords in the high
		end. Ms. Baek opens her album with a stern warning to the girl who could do better, letting an
		intense electro-funk keyboard solo take over in the coda as she reminds the listener not to play
		his &quot;stupid _____ lovegame.&quot;
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">2. You&#39;re so lonely now, so you need me back by your side again*--Roaring synths in the low end
		and haunting fuzz guitar creates a spooky ambience that morphs into a solo in the coda.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">3. I am not your ocean anymore--The roomy snares, elegant keys and yes, sax solos overlaying the
		slow&amp;steady straight 16ths on this track form the spitting image of a city-pop slow jam.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">4. Hall&amp;Oates--A rare ballad on the album backed by a minimal keyboard accompaniment.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">5. Ms Delicate--Another track which wears its city pop influence on its sleeve, albeit with an
		electro R&amp;B breakdown in the bridge.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">6. Interlude--clean guitar, low-pass piano and a healthy heaping of reverb.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">7. Loner--Calm bossa rhythms in the drum machine plus those oh-so-fuzzy key organ chords. Final
		chorus adds some soothing low-end keys, choral backing vocals and a plinky sample that I just
		like.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">8. &quot;HOMESWEETHOME&quot;*--The first of the dancier tracks on this record. Ms. Baek breaks into the
		chorus with a magic key switch on the synths that paints the dancepop skeleton with a sunny
		disposition.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">9. Loveless*--On the outside, another run-of-the-mill K-R&amp;B single--4/4 swung 8ths on the drum
		machine, plinky key riffs and all--but the sax accompaniment weaving throughout and the
		extraordinary range Ms. Baek&#39;s vocals bring out here give this track its own character.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">10. Hate you--Thumping kicks and in-your-face synth chords give this track a distinctly
		#rebellious tone. Under a different lyricist I might have come to enjoy this track but Yerin&#39;s
		not-quite-there delivery now layered with a rather limited vocabulary of insults proved too much
		for me in the end.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">11. 0415--A groovy dancepop beat which gets its depth from a syncopated wood-block sample and an
		entrancing xylophone line in the chorus.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">12. I&#39;ll be your family!--Cozy, chill, city pop-inspired. Glimmering keys, faint guitar lines
		and Yerin&#39;s soft oohs and aahs glide the listener through this track.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">13. I&#39;m in love--Roomy vocals and straight keyboard chords make for an uplifting slow jam.
	</p>
	<p style="max-width: 60%">14. Bubbles&amp;Mushrooms*--Not listed as explicit but features a naughty word near the 45-second
		mark.Tight, peppy drum beats cut through bubbly synths, whirring chords and cutesy backing
		vocals (love is a bubble!) in this hip album closer. Filtered kicks pump the listener through
		the bridge before the comp returns in full force for the final chorus. Ms. Baek&#39;s curt and
		carefree lyrics make this track into a sympathetic acid-trip near-parody of the album&#39;s gravity
		as a whole, and I&#39;m all for it.
